Adds a series of absurdly overpowered weapons to the game to mess around with.

Press 1 to summon a red spear that will instantly kill any creature it hits

Press 2 to summon a green spear that will fully heal any creature it hits, and revive
dead creatures

Press 3 to summon a pink eraser rock that will delete anything it hits

Press 4 to summon a blue rock that will "save" any creature it hits

Press 5 to create a copy of your last "saved" creature at the blue rock's position

Press 6 to summon a red grenade that will kill all creatures in the room upon hitting
a wall (This ONLY works upon hitting a wall, it can be a bit janky)
